bash semantics:

pipe means start a new node
if there is multiple input sources the last one is taken (wether heredoc or file)
if multiple out files are provided the last one is used but others should be opened(created) as well
if error encountered when trying to open a file the exec fails
exit status of pgroup = exit status of last command in the chain
io takes procsedance over pipe
if a node doesn't have any command the shell still has to open io streams
when builtins are in pipeline they run in subshells
